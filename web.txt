The internet is a large network of computers that work with one another. Computers can be linked with one another either
through wires (ethernet cables) or wirelessly. In order for certain computers to properly link with one another a router is used 
as a device to ensure this happens. All the data a computer recieves from a router is stored in what is called a server. When you click on a link
a router connects to you to another network and your able to see what is stored in that network.
